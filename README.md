## Configuration
On first load you should run `PackerInstall`

`command-t` and `coc` need to be compiled to get up and running.

### Command-t
Navigate to `~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/command-t.nvim` and run `make`

### Coc
Navigate to `~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/coc.nvim` and run `npm ci`
